## Improving Food Company Campaign Effectiveness
**Project Bakground** :

In the competitive food industry, food companies often face challenges in determining the most effective campaign methods to promote their products and reach the right target audience. In this context, food companies that do not yet know which campaigns are most effective, need a deeper understanding of successful marketing strategies.

**Objective** :

The objective of this project is to identify the most effective marketing campaign for the food company. In achieving this goal, the company will use analytical approaches and rigorous testing methods to evaluate the results of the campaigns.

**Result** :

As we can see from the p-value, the average value of sales figures on promotions 1 and 3 is not significantly different. But the difference between promotion 1 and 2 is as good as promotion 2 vs 3. If you look at the corresponding t-value, you can say that promotion 1 and 3 are better than promotion 2.
